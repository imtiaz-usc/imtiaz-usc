About Me:
- ðŸ’¡ I started my career as an engineer, earning my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California. As I worked on building systems, I became increasingly curious about the 'why' behind product decisionsâ€”the strategy, the customer needs, and how technical execution drives business outcomes. That curiosity led me into product management, where I now translate complex challenges into scalable, high-value solutions.
- ðŸ’« Iâ€™ve worked at Microsoft, AT&T, Boeing, and startups like Export Portal, leading cross-functional teams to drive adoption, optimize user experience, and boost revenue through data-backed strategies. My experience spans AI, enterprise security, SMB strategy, and full-stack development, allowing me to bridge the gap between business needs and engineering execution seamlessly.
- ðŸ™Œ As a technically adept Product Manager, I thrive on challenges that push me to growâ€”whether thatâ€™s shaping product strategy, leading engineering discussions, or driving high-impact initiatives. I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and refine my craft.
